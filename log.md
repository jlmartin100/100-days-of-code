# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 4, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Working on Python algorithms, intermediate PostgreSQL.

**Thoughts:** I don't always see the path forward, but I can play and try a few different things until I figure it out.  And if I can't figure it out, there's a whole universe of coders out there who have trod a similar path.

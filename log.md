# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 4, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Working on Python algorithms, intermediate PostgreSQL.

**Thoughts:** I don't always see the path forward, but I can play and try a few different things until I figure it out.  And if I can't figure it out, there's a whole universe of coders out there who have trod a similar path.

### Day 2: April 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Using the Mode SQL tutorials to work on intermediate and advanced SQL.

**Thoughts:** I was using queries with much more advanced array aggregations and json features in my last job, but there's a donut hole in my knowledge.  There are some intermediate SQL functions that I haven't really encountered before.  This is great, because it increases my toolbox and makes it easier for me to build more advanced and complex queries. SQL doesn't really lend itself to project snippets I can display for this log. But the fun project-based stuff will come a little later.
